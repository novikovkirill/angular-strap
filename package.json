It used to leverage the JavaScript code written by Bootstrap's contributors to minimize work, retro-compatibility issues & time to market.\n>\nWhile it worked pretty well, it required a big JavaScript payload: both jQuery & Bootstrap libraries. When the 1.2 release of AngularJS showed up with the ngAnimate module, greatly simplifying DOM manipulation, we knew it was time for a rewrite!\n\n- If you don't want to use `ngAnimate`, you will have to include a tiny [ngAnimate mock](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/wiki/ngAnimate-mock).\n\n## Documentation and examples\n\n+ Check the [documentation](http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap) and [changelog](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/releases).\n\n\n\n## Quick start\n\n+ Include the required libraries:\n\n>\n``` html\n<script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.16/angular.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"//oss.maxcdn.com/angular.strap/2.0.0/angular-strap.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"//oss.maxcdn.com/angular.strap/2.0.0/angular-strap.tpl.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n+ Inject the `ngStrap` module into your app:\n\n>\n``` JavaScript\nangular.module('myApp', ['mgcrea.ngStrap']);\n```\n\n\n## Developers\n\nClone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap.git`, [download the latest release](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/zipball/master) or install with bower `bower install angular-strap --save`.\n\nAngularStrap is tested with `karma` against the latest stable release of AngularJS.\n\n>\n\t$ npm install --dev\n\t$ gulp test\n\nYou can build the latest version using `gulp`.\n\n>\n\t$ gulp build\n\nYou can quickly hack around (the docs) with:\n\n>\n\t$ gulp serve\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease submit all pull requests the against master branch. If your unit test contains JavaScript patches or features, you should include relevant unit tests.
